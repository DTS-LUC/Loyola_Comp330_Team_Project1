The Pequod Meets @TheDelight.
The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and
days went by; the life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and
another ship, most miserably misnamed the Delight, was
descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were fixed upon her
broad beams, called shears, which, in some whaling-ships,
cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine feet;
serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.
Upon the stranger�s shears were beheld the shattered,
white ribs, and some few splintered planks, of what had
once been a whale-boat; but you now saw through this
wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled, halfunhinged,
and bleaching skeleton of a @horse.
�Hast seen the White Whale?�
�Look!� replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his
taffrail; and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck.
�Hast killed him?�
